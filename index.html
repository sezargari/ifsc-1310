  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Secondary Article</a></h2>
  <p>When developing a website, two different approaches could be used. Originally, graceful degradation was used. This approach is when developers focus more on the experience of a website on the latest and most popular browsers, while making sure everything else just “supports” the website. In engineering, where this approach was inspired from, the practice of graceful degradation of systems was used to prevent catastrophic failure when switching to a new system. If the old system wasn’t maintained during transition, chaos would ensue if something happened. To remedy this problem, the old system would be maintained less and less, until the new system was used exclusively. </p>
  <p>Moving this line of thinking to websites, the same rules don’t apply. If a company is moving to a new system, all the employees are forced to transition to it. Outside of business, not everyone is on the latest system. Most people don’t have the newest phone or have the newest web browser installed. This is important to take into consideration when designing web pages. If the developer only decides to fully support the latest and greatest, most users won’t have the intended experience.</p>
  <p>This reason is why the progressive enhancement approach is much more effective in delivering the developer’s intended experience to the most amount of people. Every browser is designed to do one thing: view the content of websites. If the focus if first and foremost on the content itself, then that helps everyone have a better experience. Once the contend is made to the developer’s liking, then styles can be added. After everything is looking nice, then some behavior can be added to wrap everything up. As the developer moves down the line from HTML, to CSS, and finally JavaScript, fewer and fewer devices are able to use the code as intended by the developer. That is the reason why it is important to focus a lot of effort in development to the content itself.</p>
