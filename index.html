      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Article</a></h2>
      <p>When developing a website, two different approaches could be used. Originally, graceful degradation was used. This approach is when developers focus more on the experience of a website on the latest and most popular browsers, while making sure everything else just “supports” the website. In engineering, where this approach was inspired from, the practice of graceful degradation of systems was used to prevent catastrophic failure when switching to a new system. If the old system wasn’t maintained during transition, chaos would ensue if something happened. To remedy this problem, the old system would be maintained less and less, until the new system was used exclusively. </p>
      <p>Moving this line of thinking to websites, the same rules don’t apply. If a company is moving to a new system, all the employees are forced to transition to it. Outside of business, not everyone is on the latest system. Most people don’t have the newest phone or have the newest web browser installed. This is important to take into consideration when designing web pages. If the developer only decides to fully support the latest and greatest, most users won’t have the intended experience.</p>
      <p>This reason is why the progressive enhancement approach is much more effective in delivering the developer’s intended experience to the most amount of people. Every browser is designed to do one thing: view the content of websites. If the focus if first and foremost on the content itself, then that helps everyone have a better experience. Once the contend is made to the developer’s liking, then styles can be added. After everything is looking nice, then some behavior can be added to wrap everything up. As the developer moves down the line from HTML, to CSS, and finally JavaScript, fewer and fewer devices are able to use the code as intended by the developer. That is the reason why it is important to focus a lot of effort in development to the content itself.</p>
      
      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>I would say that I learned a lot this semester. Before, I have only taken classes over C++, Assembly, Java, and other lower-level languages. This class helped me see how the front end is developed.  HTML and CSS were pretty different than what I was used to programming. From my experience in this class, web development is more an art than a science. Before this semester, when I was given a coding problem, I would just start coding right away.  My though process was very linear.</p>
      <p>I attempted to do the same for the SpaceX project, but I found myself not really knowing what to do. I stopped what I was doing and got out a sheet of paper to start sketching the general idea of what the website was going to look like. This top-down approach felt weird at first, but really helped in getting an idea of what I wanted to do.</p>
      <p>Still, after completing the first draft of the SpaceX project, I still had several things to fix. A few suggestions that were made were to style the table on the history page, make the images and text vertically align on the home page, as well as make the active page on the navigation bar highlighted. I ended up taking all these suggestions and incorporating them into the website, as I felt it would look better than if I were to leave them out.</p>
      <p>The biggest problem I faced was making the cycling images on the home page responsive. The CSS code that worked previously with single images was causing problems. It turned out that jQuery has two lines of code that easily solved this. Setting fit to 1 and width to 100% made the images scaled to the correct size upon the refresh of the page.</p>
